# algorithms
This repository contains implementations of some common algorithms in Java. 

This is meant to just be practice. The programs assume Integer data structures (i.e graphs are all implemented with Integer vertices)

In each directory contains two .jar files, one containing the core java files (libraries not included), the other suffixed with 'Runnable', which is executable.
